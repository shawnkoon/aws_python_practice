7. **Tips**: At the bottom of each python files, I wrote down few things I learend while coding.

## Quick Start

Set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.aws/credentials``):


```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
```

Then, set up a default region (in e.g. ``~/.aws/config``):

```
[default]
region=us-east-1
```
